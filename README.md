Space Privateers is a adventure game set in far future. Player plays a space
privateer who has recently docked with a merchant city vessel and plans to
plunder some of the loot before escaping. The task will not be easy and there
are many dangers awaiting in the deep corridors and rooms of the city vessel.

Currently only Linux 32-bit binaries are provided at [Bintray] [1]. But it is
possible to fetch package from [Hackage] [2] and build it manually.

Space Privateers uses [LambdaHack] [3] engine.
